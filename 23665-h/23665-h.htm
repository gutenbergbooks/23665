<div class="footnote pgbrk endrule">
<p><a href="#fna.i.1" name="fn.i.1" id="fn.i.1">1.</a> <i>The Rip.</i> A machine used in poultry-yards, under which it is
usual to confine the mother-bird with the young brood, till it has
acquired strength to follow her. The word is derived from the Saxon
<i>Hrip</i>, meaning a covering, or protection, for the young.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.2" name="fn.i.2" id="fn.i.2">2.</a> <i>The Tailor-Bird.</i> So called from the singular manner in which it
constructs its nest, which is composed of two leaves, sewed together
with wonderful skill by the little tailor, whose bill serves him for a
needle, and the fine fibres of leaves furnish him with a substitute for
thread, by which means he attaches a dead leaf to a living one, growing
at the end of a branch. The Tailor-Bird is an inhabitant of India.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.3" name="fn.i.3" id="fn.i.3">3.</a> <i>The Golden-crested Wren</i> is the smallest of the British Birds; it
takes its name from a circle of gold-coloured feathers, bordered with
black, forming an arch above its eyes, which it has the power of raising
or depressing; it is a native of every part of Europe, and is also to be
found in Asia and America.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.4" name="fn.i.4" id="fn.i.4">4.</a> <i>Halcyon</i>, or <i>Kingfisher</i>. Esteemed the most beautiful of our native
birds; but its form is clumsy, and its bill very disproportionate to its
size. It inhabits the banks of rivers and streams, where it will sit for
hours on a projecting branch, watching for its prey. The ancients
relate many fabulous stories of this bird, as that of its laying its eggs
in the depth of winter, and that during the time of its incubation the
weather remains perfectly calm, whence the expression <i>Halcyon days</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.5" name="fn.i.5" id="fn.i.5">5.</a> <i>Cuculus indicator.</i> A bird of the Cuckoo kind, found in the interior
parts of Africa; it has a shrill note, which the natives answer by a soft
whistle; and the birds repeating the note, the natives are thereby conducted
to the wild Bee-hives, which this bird frequents.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.6" name="fn.i.6" id="fn.i.6">6.</a> <i>Cassowary.</i> A large singular bird found in the island of Java, in
Africa, and the southern parts of India. The head of this bird is armed
with a kind of natural helmet, extending from the base of the bill to near
half-way over the head.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.7" name="fn.i.7" id="fn.i.7">7.</a> <i>Flamingo.</i> A bird of the crane kind, but web-footed, whose plumage
is of a bright scarlet: when standing erect, it measures above six
feet, though its body is not larger than that of a Goose; and is a native
of Africa, Persia, and South America.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.8" name="fn.i.8" id="fn.i.8">8.</a> <i>Ptarmigan.</i> The white grouse, or white game, inhabits the
Highlands of Scotland and the Western Islands; it prefers the coldest situations
on the highest mountains, where it burrows under the snow. It
changes its feathers twice in the year, and about the end of February
puts on its summer dress of dusky brown, ash, and orange-coloured
feathers; which it loses in winter for a plumage perfectly white, except
a black line between the bill and the eye. The legs and toes are warmly
clothed with a thick long coat of soft white feathers.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.9" name="fn.i.9" id="fn.i.9">9.</a> <i>The Chough.</i> This bird, which is about the size of the Daw, has a
long curved bill, sharp at the point, which, as well as the legs and feet,
is of a bright scarlet, contrasting beautifully with its black plumage,
which varies, as the light falls on it, to a deep purple violet. Its general
haunts are the crevices of high cliffs in Devonshire and Cornwall.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.10" name="fn.i.10" id="fn.i.10">10.</a> <i>The Widow</i>, or <i>Widah Bird</i>, is a species of Bunting, a native
of Angola and other parts of Africa; and is remarkable for the feathers
of its tail. The two middle ones are about four inches long, and
ending in a long thread; the two next are thirteen inches in length,
broad, and narrowing towards the points: from these proceeds another
long thread.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.11" name="fn.i.11" id="fn.i.11">11.</a> <i>Yaffil, the Woodpecker.</i> The name Yaffil is provincial, but is so
very expressive of the noise it continually makes, that I have preferred
it on that account. It is a beautiful bird, and is sometimes called the
English Parrot; the colour of its plumage, green, yellow, and scarlet,
giving it some resemblance to that bird.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.12" name="fn.i.12" id="fn.i.12">12.</a> <i>The Numidian Crane</i>, or <i>Demoiselle</i>, from the elegance of its
appearance, and its singular carriage, is called the Demoiselle, which
means the Young Lady; for this bird walks very gracefully, and
sometimes skips and leaps, as though it were trying to dance.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.13" name="fn.i.13" id="fn.i.13">13.</a> <i>Guillemot.</i> A sea-bird, of which there are several species numerously
spread over the northern world; from whence they come towards
winter to the British shores, and remain till they have reared their
young. It is sometimes called &ldquo;the foolish Guillemot,&rdquo; from its stupidity;
for when their companions are shot one after another, they have so little
sense of danger, that they make a small circuit, and then return and
settle in the same place, to share the same fate.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.14" name="fn.i.14" id="fn.i.14">14.</a> <i>Toucan.</i> A native of America, where it builds in the hollows
of trees, and sits at the entrance, ready to peck at the monkeys, who
often endeavour to destroy and eat the young. It is about the size of
a Magpie, but the head large in proportion, to enable it to support
its immense bill, which is six inches and one-half in length, but extremely
thin. It is a mild inoffensive bird, and easily tamed, but cannot
endure the cold of our climate. The feathers of the breast are highly
esteemed by the natives.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.15" name="fn.i.15" id="fn.i.15">15.</a> <i>Cross-bill.</i> So called because the two mandibles cross each other
in different directions. They feed chiefly on the seeds of fir-trees; the
singular construction of their bills being admirably adapted to separate
the seeds of the cones. The pips of apples are also a favourite food,
and, to obtain them, they split the apple with one stroke of their bill;
they are consequently found to be very injurious to orchards. It has
been observed that they have been more <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
  original reads 'freqently'">frequently</ins> seen in England
since the fir-tree has been more generally planted than formerly.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.16" name="fn.i.16" id="fn.i.16">16.</a> <i>Siskin.</i> A migratory bird, which is seen in the southern parts of
England at the time of the barley harvest, and is sometimes called
the Barley-bird. It has a pleasing note, and is sold as a singing-bird
in the London bird-shops by the name of the Aberdevine. The accusation
of its flirtation with the Greenfinch is to be understood as pure
scandal, the most prying naturalists never having discovered any particular
attachment between them.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.17" name="fn.i.17" id="fn.i.17">17.</a> <i>Razor-bill.</i> A migratory sea-bird, which visits the northern shores
in spring, and leaves them in winter: they lay a single egg on the ledges
of the rocks without any nest, and on which it is said to be fixed with a
cement.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.18" name="fn.i.18" id="fn.i.18">18.</a> <i>Spoon-bill.</i> So called from the construction of the bill, which is flat
the whole length, but widens towards the end in the form of a spoon
or spatula; and is equally remarkable in its substance, not being hard
like bone, but flexible like whalebone. They feed on snakes, worms,
frogs, and fish, even on shell-fish, which they first break with their bills.</p>

<p><a href="#fna.i.19" name="fn.i.19" id="fn.i.19">19.</a> <i>The Agami</i>, or <i>Trumpeter</i>. A native of America, remarkable for
a singular noise, resembling the instrument from which it takes its
name.</p>
